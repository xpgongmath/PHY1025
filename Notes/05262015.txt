Test 1 Review Notes

Speed = distance/time

- instantaneus
- average = (Vf-Vi)/2

acceleration = chagen in Velocity / time

Free fall

g = 10m/s^2 toward the earth

V = Vo + at
from rest V = gt

Distance = (1/2)gt^2 (from rest)


Chapter 1
How did people measure things that couldnt be measured?

Scientific method....

Scientific hypothesis...can be proven wrong.


Chapter 2

Coin Moon Ratio ...

Hypothesis - An educated guess

Theory -  a well tested large body of info...

Fact - a measurement...

Law - like the law of gravity....

Intertia -  an objects resistance to change in motion...

Motion - when there is no net external forces acting on an object?...

A hockey puck sliding across the ice...

Newtons first law...

Inertia Video...

Table Cloth...

Ring...

...

Beaker with the index card and penny...

Discuss horizontal motion of an object falling off a moving train...
an example...

Discuss the rope problems.....scafolding etc...

Relative Motion...change in direction


Vector Quantiy - Magnitude and direction

Accelertation can be a vector


Net Force - 

Ropes in an angle...!!!!

Support Force that is countering gravity

Relative Motion
Outside looking in...

Difference between instantaneous and average speed

Average Speed = total disance of total time...

Isntantaneous Speed...

Calculate a distance traveled 

Discuss all the situation for velocity that result in accleration...

Change in direction is acceleration...

Calc average speed...

Velocity and accleration of an object in circular motion...

Calc aceleration given a change in velocity...

Freefall d=(1/2)g*t^2

Do in two parts if a parablola....
dropped from rest....

Practice Exam....

1. Erastophenes.....used a deep well and pillar and the distance
2.
