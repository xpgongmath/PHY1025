Momentum...

Impulse chages momentum...

P = mV

I = Ft

Ft =Δmv

2Ft = 2Δmv


P = work/time

1 joule per second = 1 watt
1 kilowatt = 1000 watts

Mechanical energy - 
Potential
Kinetic

PE = mgh

Energy of motion
KE = (1/2)m * v^2

Is the first deriv of KE Impulse?


Work - Energy Theorum
Look at the slide

Momentum is vector
Kinetic is scalar

Machine...

Efficiency (useful energy outout)/(total energy output)

Energy is the ability tp do work..

Potential and Kinetic

Thermal

Chemical

electrical 

Nuclear...


KE = 1/2 * m * v^2


Energy is conserved = not lost but transformed...
