Chapter 2 Newtons Law
Learned about intertia
Vector and scalar quantity
If we add vector then the magnitude matters
Sigma NET FORCE
At rest or constant speed and direction
Support force counters gravity

Equilibrium of moving things

Static equalibirum 
Dynamic Equilibrium

Whether or not something under goes changes in motion

Take a look at the man pulley example

Look at the Parallelogram Rule



Chapter 3 Linear Motion
Motion is relative

Speed = distance/time

V = d/t

Average Speed = entire distance traveled / time interval

Instantaneous Speed

Table 3.1

Average Velocity

Acceleration
Formultated by Galileo based on his experiments with incline planes


Free Fall - How Fast?

V = at

Distance = (1/2) x acceleration x time x time
Distance = (1/2)gt^2

Be careful Free fall vertex is considered 10 m/s velocity

Look at Accerating Car Slide

Look at dart in a Blow Gun
