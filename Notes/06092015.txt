F  = ma
a  = F/m
PE = mgh
w  = Fd
KE = (1/2)mv^2
p  = mv
Pinit = Pfinal

Newtons 2nd Law
F = ma

Newtons 3rd Law
Action and Reaction 
always in a pair

Energy
is always conserved
work = Fd  (F = mg) related to PE
PE = mgh

Pendulum model

Momentum is also conserved

Energy cant be negative direction

Momentum has direction (vector)

Impulse = Force * time = Ft
Ft = change in momentum

Power is the rate which work is done

Work Energy Theorum

Machines
Work(in) = Work(out)

(F * d)in = (F * d)out

Eff = (useful work) / (total energy)

Support Force

mass is the same 
weight may change depending on g

Free fall 
gravity is always acting upon it

Air resistence causes terminal velocity

Action / Reaction
force pairs

Pythagoeran triangle for force
